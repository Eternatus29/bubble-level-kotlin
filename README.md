# Clinometer (Bubble Level App)

Clinometer is an Android application that uses your phone's accelerometers to measure the inclination of the device, functioning as a bubble level. This app is perfect for DIY projects, carpentry, and ensuring that your surfaces are perfectly level.

## Features

- Measures the angle of inclination in real-time.
- User-friendly interface with a bubble level design.
- Displays the angle in degrees and provides visual feedback.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Android Studio installed (Jellyfish or higher).
- A physical Android device connected to your development environment.
- Basic understanding of Kotlin and Android development.
